# YouTube -> MIDI for Noobs

A collection of scripts for interacting with Google's recent [MT3 multi-track MIDI transcription model](https://github.com/magenta/mt3).
I had a lot of fun playing with this model, and wanted to make a more accessible demo for laypeople.
Thus, the notebooks in this repo skip the audio upload and allows direct transcription from YouTube.

## How to use
Open one of the following Colab notebooks with your Google account. 
The notebooks are totally browser-based, with no downloads required.
